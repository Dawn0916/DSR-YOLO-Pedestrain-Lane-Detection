### My Portfolio Project at Data Science Retreat
Enhancing Safety in Autonomous Driving

### Motivation and Goal of the Project
# Motivation:
 • Safety is a big concern when it comes to embracing self-driving cars or not!
 • Real-time object detection is critical in ensuring safety in autonomous driving
 • Quick, accurate decisions can sometimes save lives in a dangerous situation
# Goal:
 • General: Enhance safety in autonomous driving
 • Specifically: Implement a real-time object 
detection system for self-driving cars


### How to run the code?
Step 1: Create a virtural environment: python -m venv venv
Step 2: Activate the virtural environment: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Step 3: Run the following code according to your interests:
1. App1:  Object Detection for an Uploaded Video: 
streamlit run .\app1_pedestrain_uploaded_video\myapp.py

2. App2: Object Detection for Video Streaming: 
streamlit run .\app2_pedestrain_streaming\myapp.py

3. App3: Object & Lane Detection for Video Streaming: 
streamlit run .\app3_pedestrain_lane_streaming\myapp.py

4. Lane Detection result: 
python .\lane_detection\lane_detection.py

5. Combination of Object and Lane Detection: 
python .\combine_lane_object\combine.py

6. In addition to Combination of Object and Lane Detection, give alram when the pedestrain is in danger: 
python .\combine_lane_object\combined_with_alarm.py
